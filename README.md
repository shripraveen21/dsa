Ride matching service
This code implements a ride matching service that allows users to find the shortest path between two locations,
locate the nearest driver, and visualize the results on an interactive map. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for path finding, geodesic distance calculations, and GUI components for user interaction.
